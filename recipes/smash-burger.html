    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Create a restaurant style Smash Burger at home in minutes and for a lot less money. You are going to love the crispy brown crust that forms as the burger cooks so quickly.</p> 
        
    <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
    <ul>
        <li>Ground Beef. I use an 80/20 meant to fat ratio. One pound makes four burgers.</li>
        <li>Seasoning. Use your favorite beef seasoning salt. I like Montreal Steak Seasoning.</li>
        <li>Hamburger Buns. Butter and toast your buns before cooking burgers so they are ready as soon as the burgers are.</li>
        <li>Hamburger Sauce.</li>
        <li>Pickles. We like dill pickles.</li>
        
    </ul>   

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Form hamburger into four loosely shaped balls. Fresh ground beef will have more flavor than frozen meat.</li>
        <li>Heat Griddle. You want your griddle hot, about 375 degrees F. I like to put my cast iron griddle on my outdoor grill but you can also do it on your stovetop but I find it sets my smoke alarm off frequently! If you don’t have a griddle you can also use a cast iron pan.</li>
        <li>Place the balls of meat onto a hot griddle.</li>
        <li>After placing hamburger on hot griddle place a piece of parchment paper over the top and then smash. You want a nice thin patty. The parchment paper keeps the meat from sticking to the spatula.</li>
        <li>Add seasoning salt generously.</li>
        <li>Cook for 2-3 minutes, the burger cooks fast. The edges of the burger will be lacy and may even have some holes in it, this is what creates the crispy edges that are a trademark of the Smash Burger.</li>
        <li>Flip the burger by using a metal spatula to “scrap” the burger up and flip. You want to get all that crusty goodness that is forming on the other side of the burger as it cooks.</li>
        <li>Add cheese immediately after flipping.</li>
        <li>Put the sauce onto the bottom of the bun, then add the burger, and then the pickles. and then close the buns.</li>
        
    </ol>
