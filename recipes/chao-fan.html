        <li>In the same wok, add onion and celery, and stir-fry about 2-minutes, shaking pan to prevent browning. Add 1 tablespoon soy sauce and 1 to 2 tablespoons boiling water. Reduce heat to medium. Cover and steam 1-minute.</li>
        <li>Add mushrooms, cover and cook until tender 1 to 2-minutes. Remove vegetables and reserve. Reduce heat to medium and add 2 tablespoons oil. When hot, add ginger and garlic, and sauté. Discard when lightly browned. Add chicken, then toss and fry for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add rice and cooked vegetables. Toss until hot. Add oil if needed. Make a well in center of mixture. Add eggs and stir until scrambled. Mix well, then season with soy sauce and serve immediately.</li>
